# Pacman
A tiny game engine inspired by the structure of DOOM

Get ready for a new twist on the classic arcade game, Pacman, with Pacman BSP. 
This Java-based game uses Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) to procedurally generate levels, 
providing a unique and challenging experience for players. 
As you guide Pacman through the maze, collect pellets and power-ups while avoiding ghosts. 
But be careful, as the levels get harder as you progress through the game. 
With BSP-generated levels, you'll never play the same game twice in Pacman BSP.
